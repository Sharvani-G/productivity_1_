# Task Management System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Your planner was saving tasks to MongoDB but **not loading them back after page refresh**. The frontend was also missing **delete and edit functionality** that syncs with the database.

---

## ✅ What Was Added

### 1. **Backend Enhancements** (`server.js`)

#### New Endpoints:
- **`DELETE /api/tasks/:weekKey/:dayIndex/:taskId`** - Deletes a specific task from the database
- **`PUT /api/tasks/:weekKey/:dayIndex/:taskId`** - Updates a task's text and status in the database

#### Database Operations:
- Tasks are now identified by unique IDs (`task_<timestamp>_<random>`)
- Delete operations filter out the task from the day array
- Update operations modify the task in place while keeping the ID intact

---

### 2. **Frontend Storage Module** (`public/storage.js`)

#### New Functions:
```javascript
deleteTaskFromBackend(weekKey, dayIndex, taskId)
updateTaskOnBackend(weekKey, dayIndex, taskId, text, status)
```

These functions handle DELETE and PUT requests to the backend.

---

### 3. **UI Module Rewrite** (`public/ui.js`)

#### Key Improvements:

✅ **Task Card with Edit & Delete Buttons**
- Each task now has two buttons: `Edit` and `Delete`
- Buttons are styled with proper colors (green for Edit, red for Delete)
- Buttons disable during API calls to prevent double-submission

✅ **Delete Functionality**
- Sends `DELETE` request to backend
- Removes task from MongoDB
- Removes task from local state (`window.tasksByWeek`)
- Removes task from DOM instantly
- Shows success/error message

✅ **Edit Functionality**
- Allows users to modify task text and status
- Sends `PUT` request to backend to update MongoDB
- Updates local state on success
- Shows success/error message

✅ **Input Validation**
- Empty tasks cannot be saved
- Max length of 100 characters for task text
- Confirmation dialog before deleting

✅ **User Experience**
- Loading states (button text changes to "Saving..." or "Deleting...")
- Toast notifications for success/error messages
- Auto-focus on input fields when editing
- Disabled buttons during API operations

✅ **Error Handling**
- Try-catch blocks around all API calls
- Meaningful error messages displayed to user
- Buttons re-enable if operation fails

## 📊 Data Flow

### **Adding a Task:**
1. User clicks `+ Task` button
2. New empty task card appears with input field
3. User enters task text and selects status
4. Clicks `Save` button
5. ✅ Backend: `PUT /api/tasks/:weekKey/:dayIndex/:taskId` stores in MongoDB
6. ✅ Frontend: Task updates to display mode with Edit/Delete buttons
7. ✅ Local state: Task added to `window.tasksByWeek`

### **Loading Tasks on Page Refresh:**
1. Page loads, `main.js` initializes
2. Gets current week's Monday date
3. Calls `loadTasksFromBackend(weekKey)` → `GET /api/tasks/:weekKey`
4. Fetches tasks from MongoDB
5. Calls `updateWeekUI()` to render all tasks
6. Each task card is created with Edit/Delete buttons

### **Editing a Task:**
1. User clicks `Edit` button
2. Task card switches to input mode
3. User modifies text and/or status
4. Clicks `Save` button
5. ✅ Backend: `PUT /api/tasks/:weekKey/:dayIndex/:taskId` updates MongoDB
6. ✅ Frontend: Task reverts to display mode with new content
7. ✅ Local state: Task updated in `window.tasksByWeek`

### **Deleting a Task:**
1. User clicks `Delete` button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms deletion
4. ✅ Backend: `DELETE /api/tasks/:weekKey/:dayIndex/:taskId` removes from MongoDB
5. ✅ Frontend: Task card removed from DOM instantly
6. ✅ Local state: Task removed from `window.tasksByWeek`

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

✅ **Input Validation**
- Non-empty task check
- Max length validation
- XSS prevention (using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML`)

✅ **Database Operations**
- Unique task IDs prevent collisions
- WeekKey validation ensures proper week isolation
- Delete operations verify task exists before removal

✅ **API Safety**
- Error responses return meaningful HTTP status codes
- Failed operations don't corrupt local state
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Task Display | Static, no buttons | Edit & Delete buttons |
| Task Editing | Limited inline editing | Proper modal-like editing |
| Task Deletion | Not available | Confirmed deletion with sync |
| Error Messages | Silent failures | Toast notifications |
| Loading State | No indication | "Saving..." text in button |
| Status Change | Manual click | Instant color change |
| Focus Management | None | Auto-focus on edit |

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Add a new task and refresh page → task persists
- [ ] Edit a task text → updates on page and in database
- [ ] Change task status → card color changes instantly
- [ ] Delete a task → task disappears from UI and database
- [ ] Navigate to different week and back → tasks still there
- [ ] Try to save empty task → error message shows
- [ ] Disconnect from backend → error message shown
- [ ] Click delete button multiple times quickly → only one deletion

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:4000/weekly
   ```

3. **Test workflow:**
   - Add a task on Monday
   - Refresh page (F5)
   - Task should still be there
   - Click Edit, change text, save
   - Click Delete, confirm
   - Task should disappear from database

4. **Check database:**
   - Open MongoDB Atlas or local MongoDB CLI
   - Query the `weeks` collection
   - Verify task changes are saved

## 📞 Support

If tasks are not loading:
1. Check MongoDB connection in `.env`
2. Verify `MONGODB_URI` is correct
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Check server logs for API errors

If delete/edit not working:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check Network tab for failed requests
3. Check Console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify task IDs are present in DOM
